# *Anker*

Worked as sole developer    
*Summer 2023, January 2025 - february 2025*

I started working on this the summer of 2023 since I wanted *[Placid Plastic Duck Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1999360/Placid_Plastic_Duck_Simulator)* but I was cheap and thought I could make it myself, but worse. So I made it in 2D, then later at Yrgo we were supposed to make a mobile game, so I ressurected this game and upgraded it. In about a month I added
- Cloud Saving
- A shop
- A way to visit other peoples pools and look at their ducks  

I also added some additional ducks and I reworked the system for how you get ducks so that instead of only getting every duck once and then not being able to get them again. Now when you have every duck you can start to get duplicates so you can have 2 of each, then 3 of each, etc. etc.
