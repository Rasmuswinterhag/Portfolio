Worked as **Programmer**  
*2024 november - 2025 June*

---

I worked on a little bit of everything but some highlights are: 
- The mediaplayer - I built almost the whole thing  
- The Glitch system - Built the whole thing, I built it to be easy to use for the developers
- Animated images -  I modified the normal Image prefab to add animations when you first open them, but not again after  
- Pulling keys from images - I modified the image prefab to make you able to pull keys from it
