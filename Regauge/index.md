In pre-production we had almost an entierly diffrent game idea where you would have a 1v1 stratergy game where you would control your bots and plan your moves in advance almost like "coding" your bots. Then they would execute their "code" all at the same time. When we playtested that idea it worked on paper and thought it was fun but we relized that we couldnt hide your intructions from the other person since it was going to be a PvP couch game, both would all see the same screen. By talking with our teachers and between ourselves in the team it eventually evolved into what it is now.

We started this project by making a prototype, Where we tried to finish the game (code wise) in one week with a bunch of bad code. Then when we were done after that week we threw it all away to start over from the beginning now knowing the direction we want to take the game better and also how some of the systems should work. It helped quite a bit, especially in the begining since thats when we were mosty loose on the concept.
