Worked as **Programmer**  
Developed: *2024 october, 02:00 - 02:00 (Made in one hour)* 

This was part of a 1h game jam that takes place during the daylight savings when you put back the clock one hour.

I made everything
### Thinking process when making the game
1. I started by thinking about the theme: bounce
2. What bounces? balls. So click to spawn a bouncy ball.
3. Numbers going up is fun. You get points when the balls bounce
4. To gamify it more the balls get destroyed when touching eachother.
5. I have time, The balls can now take three hits
