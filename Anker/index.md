I started working on this the summer of 2023 since I wanted *[Placid Plastic Duck Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1999360/Placid_Plastic_Duck_Simulator)* but I was cheap and thought I could make it myself, but worse. So I made it in 2D, then later at Yrgo we were supposed to make a mobile game, so I ressurected this game and upgraded it. I added
- Cloud Saving
- A shop
- A way to visit other peoples pools and look at their ducks
