Worked as **Programmer**    
*2025 January, 17 - 19*  

Won the ***Best Game Design*** award in the [*Global Game Jam Gothemburg*](https://globalgamejam.org/jam-sites/2025/ggj-gothenburg-25) which had the theme *Bubbles*.

I worked on most things but some highlights are:
- The collectible water drops, They combine into a bigger drop when they touch.
- The camera tracking the palyer and looking ahead of the movement.
- The camera size being dynamic with the size of the player.
- The racing meters showing where all racers are on the window.
