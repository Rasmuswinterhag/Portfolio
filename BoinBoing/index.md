Worked as **Programmer**

This was part of a 1h game jam that takes place during the daylight savings when you put back the clock one hour.

I made everything
### Thinking process when making the game
1. I started by thinking about the theme: bounce
2. What bounces? balls. So ill make it so that you click to spawn a bouncy ball.
3. Numbers going up is fun. You get points when the balls bounce.
4. To gamify it more the balls get destroyed when touching eachother.
5. Then I noticed that I have more time. So I added so that balls can take three hits instead of one, and they also change colour to indicate their health.
